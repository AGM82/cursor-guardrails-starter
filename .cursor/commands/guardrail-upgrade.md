# /guardrail-upgrade

Audit this project against the cursor-guardrails template, present a gap analysis by layer, and — after confirmation — implement the upgrades. Covers Layers 0–7: bootstrap through governance.

---

## Layer 0 — Bootstrap (run first, always)

1. Ask the user: "What is the full path to your cursor-guardrails template folder?"
   Example: `C:\Users\me\Projects\cursor-guardrails`
   Store this as **TEMPLATE_PATH** for all steps below.

2. **Verify and refresh the reference clone**, so every layer below reads from the latest published guardrails instead of a stale snapshot:
   - Check whether `TEMPLATE_PATH` exists and is a git repository (contains a `.git` folder).
   - **If it does not exist, or is not a git repo:** this is a one-time setup gap. Tell the user:
     > "Your template path isn't a git clone yet. Run this once, then re-run this command:
     > `git clone https://github.com/AGM82/cursor-guardrails "TEMPLATE_PATH"`
     > Use a plain clone, not GitHub's 'Use this template' button — that creates a disconnected repo with no upstream link, so it could never receive updates."
     > Stop here until the user confirms the clone exists, then continue.
   - **If it exists:** refresh it before reading anything from it: `git -C "TEMPLATE_PATH" pull --ff-only origin main`.
     - On success, the clone is now current — continue.
     - **If the pull fails** (offline, uncommitted local edits in the clone, detached HEAD, etc.): do not force, reset, or stash on the user's behalf. Instead, fall back to a staleness check — read `TEMPLATE_PATH/.cursor/guardrail-version` and compare it against the published value at `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AGM82/cursor-guardrails/main/.cursor/guardrail-version`. If the local clone is behind, warn the user (e.g. "Your reference clone is on 1.3.2; the published template is on 1.3.5 — run `git pull` in TEMPLATE_PATH when you can.") and continue using the files as they are on disk.

3. Check whether this project already has `.cursor/commands/guardrail-upgrade.md`.
   - **If it is missing** (first-time adoption): copy the entire `.cursor/commands/` folder from `TEMPLATE_PATH` into this project's `.cursor/commands/` (create `.cursor/commands/` if it does not exist), then confirm: "Commands folder bootstrapped. Continuing upgrade…"
   - **If it already exists**, continue.

> **Windows PowerShell note:** Run commands separately if `&&` fails. Replace `cmd1 && cmd2` with two separate lines.

## Layer 0.5 — Pre-upgrade baseline

Before any changes, capture the current state of the project:

Run (skip any script that does not exist in `package.json`):

```
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm run build
npm run test
```

Save the output to `.cursor/guardrail-baseline.log` (this file is gitignored — it stays local).

If there is no `package.json`, note that and skip this step.

This baseline lets you distinguish errors the guardrails introduced from errors that already existed.

---

## Layer 0.6 — Snapshot git

Save a safe undo point before making any changes:

```
git add -A
git commit -m "chore: snapshot before guardrail upgrade"
```

If this project has no git repo yet:

```
git init -b main
git add -A
git commit -m "chore: initial commit before guardrails"
```

---

## Layer 0.4 — Project profile

Not every project has the same needs. Before running the gap analysis, the
layer recommendation needs to be tailored instead of a blanket "apply
everything." There are two ways this happens — check for a prescription
first, and only fall back to asking questions if there isn't one.

### Step 1 — Check for a Throughline (or other governance tool) prescription

Look for `guardrail-prescription.json` at the project root, then
`.cursor/guardrail-prescription.json`. See `TEMPLATE_PATH/docs/guardrail-prescription.md`
for the full contract.

- **If found and `contractVersion` is `1`:**
  1. Compare its `guardrailVersion` against `TEMPLATE_PATH/.cursor/guardrail-version`. If they differ, warn the user (e.g. "This prescription was classified against v1.3.4; the reference clone is on v1.3.5 — consider re-running Throughline to re-certify.") and continue anyway — a stale prescription is still a reasonable default.
  2. Announce it: "Using a prescription from `<source>`: tier `<tier>` → layers `<requiredLayers>`, classified `<classifiedAt>`." Show `rationale` if present.
  3. Set **RECOMMENDED_LAYERS** to its `requiredLayers` and **skip Step 2** (the 3 questions) entirely.
  4. Do not write to or modify this file — it is an input the project owns, not an output of this command.
- **If found but `contractVersion` is not recognised:** warn ("Unrecognised prescription contractVersion — falling back to the standard profile questions.") and proceed to Step 2.
- **If not found:** proceed to Step 2.

### Step 2 — Self-serve project profile (only if no prescription was used)

Ask the user 3 quick questions so the layer recommendation is tailored
instead of a blanket "apply everything." The canonical questions,
type-to-domain mapping, and risk-to-layer mapping live in
`guardrail-layers.json` → `projectProfiles` (reusing the existing
`riskTiers` block — do not invent a new layer mapping).

Ask:

1. **"What kind of project is this?"** — `frontend-ui` / `backend-api` /
   `full-stack` / `library-or-cli` / `script-or-prototype`.
   Look up `projectProfiles.types[<answer>]` to see which domain rule files
   are `activeDomains` now vs `inertUntilUsedDomains` (safe to install
   either way — inert ones simply have no effect until the project grows
   into them, per `90-project-context.mdc`).
2. **"What is the risk level of this project?"** — `Low` / `Medium` / `High`.
   Look up `riskTiers[<answer>].requiredLayers` for the recommended layer set.
3. **"Does the project already have its own ESLint/Prettier/tsconfig setup?"**
   — `yes` / `no`. If `yes`, treat Layer 4 as extra merge-carefully: read
   both configs in full before adding strict settings, and never overwrite.

Store the resulting recommended layer set as **RECOMMENDED_LAYERS** — it
replaces the blanket "all" suggestion in the gap-analysis prompt below.

---

## Layer 1–5 — Audit: read both sides

Read the following files from TEMPLATE_PATH and from THIS project. For each file, note whether it exists here and — if it does — whether it contains the key content the template has.

**Layer 1 — AI instructions** (always safe to add; nothing here touches application code)

> The canonical file list for Layer 1 is maintained in `guardrail-layers.json` at the template root under `adoptionLayers["1"].files`. The list below is the human-readable reference; if they ever diverge, the JSON is authoritative.

- `.cursor/rules/00-core.mdc`
- `.cursor/rules/10-security-popia.mdc`
- `.cursor/rules/20-commits.mdc`
- `.cursor/rules/30-react-stack.mdc`
- `.cursor/rules/31-design.mdc`
- `.cursor/rules/32-ux-behavioural.mdc`
- `.cursor/rules/33-data-science.mdc`
- `.cursor/rules/40-tooling-supply-chain.mdc`
- `.cursor/rules/50-ai-tooling.mdc`
- `.cursor/rules/60-backend-api.mdc` (only relevant once the project has a server/API — safe to add regardless, it is glob-scoped and inert otherwise)
- `.cursor/rules/61-database.mdc` (only relevant once the project has a database)
- `.cursor/rules/62-deployment-observability.mdc` (only relevant once the project deploys somewhere beyond local)
- `.cursor/rules/90-project-context.mdc`
- `.cursor/commands/review.md`
- `.cursor/commands/pr.md`
- `.cursor/commands/update-deps.md`
- `.cursor/commands/guardrail-upgrade.md`
- `.cursor/hooks.json`
- `.cursor/hooks/guard-shell.mjs`
- `.cursor/hooks/guard-read.mjs`
- `.cursor/hooks/audit.mjs`
- `.cursor/mcp.json`
- `.cursorignore`
- `AGENTS.md`

**Layer 2 — Git hygiene** (safe to add; copy or merge)

- `.gitattributes`
- `.gitignore` — check for: `.env`, `.env.*`, `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `coverage/`, `.cursor/hooks/logs/`
- `.nvmrc`
- `.npmrc`
- `.editorconfig`
- `LICENSE`
- `SECURITY.md`
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- `.github/CODEOWNERS`
- `.github/dependabot.yml` — check for: `react-runtime` group, ESLint ecosystem major-bump ignores
- `.github/pull_request_template.md`

**Layer 3 — Commit discipline** (safe; adds tooling without touching source)

- `commitlint.config.mjs` (note: `.mjs`, not `.js`)
- `.husky/pre-commit`
- `.husky/commit-msg`
- `package.json` → `lint-staged` block

**Layer 4 — Code quality toolchain** (merge carefully; may surface existing errors)

- `eslint.config.js` / `eslint.config.mjs` — verify `.cursor/**` is in `ignores`/`globalIgnores`
- `.prettierrc.json`
- `tsconfig.json` — check for strict flags: `strict`, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `noImplicitOverride`, `noFallthroughCasesInSwitch`, `noUnusedLocals`, `noUnusedParameters`, `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`
- `package.json` → scripts: `typecheck`, `lint`, `lint:fix`, `format`, `test`
- `package.json` → `engines.node`

**Layer 5 — CI pipeline** (merge carefully; check for existing workflow)

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — check for: `secret-scan` job, `sast` job, `sbom` job, `npm audit` step, `npm audit signatures` step, `attest-build-provenance` step, `permissions: contents: read`, `concurrency` block

## Present gap analysis

Show a table with these columns: **Layer | File | Status | Action**

Status values:

- `MISSING` — file does not exist in this project at all
- `OUTDATED` — file exists but is missing key sections the template has
- `CURRENT` — file exists and matches template intent
- `N/A` — not applicable (e.g. project is not Node-based)

Group rows by layer. Show a summary line per layer (e.g. "Layer 1: 3 missing, 2 outdated, 11 current").

**Do not make any changes yet.** Ask the user:

> "Which layers would you like to upgrade? Enter layer numbers (e.g. `1 2 3`) or `all`. Based on Layer 0.4 (the prescription, if one was found, otherwise your answers), **RECOMMENDED_LAYERS** is recommended for a project at this risk level — reply `all` to go further than that."

---

## Upgrade approved layers (1–5)

Work through each approved layer in order. For each file:

**If MISSING:**

- Copy the file from TEMPLATE_PATH into this project.
- Files containing `<PLACEHOLDER>` text (`LICENSE`, `90-project-context.mdc`, `CODEOWNERS`, `SECURITY.md`): copy as-is and list all placeholders for the user to fill in after.

**If OUTDATED — config/tooling files** (`package.json`, `eslint.config.*`, `tsconfig.json`, `.husky/pre-commit`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `.github/dependabot.yml`):

- Read BOTH versions in full.
- Add only the missing sections — do NOT overwrite.
- Preserve all project-specific content.
- Show what you are adding before writing it.

**If OUTDATED — documentation** (`SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `AGENTS.md`):

- Show the user the specific sections that would be added.
- Get confirmation before writing.

After completing each layer, run (skip any that do not exist in `package.json`):

```
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
```

Report any errors and fix them before moving to the next layer.

---

## Layer 6 — Code compliance audit (required for existing projects)

This layer is not about files from the template — it is about aligning the **project's own code** with the rules just installed.

1. Run all checks and compare against `.cursor/guardrail-baseline.log`:

   ```
   npm run typecheck
   npm run lint
   npm run build
   ```

   Identify which errors existed before (in baseline) vs which are new (introduced by guardrails).

2. Audit `src/`, `app/`, or the project's main source directories against:
   - `.cursor/rules/90-project-context.mdc` — domain language, canonical patterns, architecture constraints
   - `.cursor/rules/10-security-popia.mdc` — input validation, secrets, personal data logging
   - `.cursor/rules/30-react-stack.mdc` — if this is a UI project

3. Output a findings table:

   | Severity       | Finding                             | File | Line |
   | -------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---- | ---- |
   | **Blocker**    | Must fix before upgrade is complete |      |      |
   | **Should-fix** | Fix soon; not a merge blocker       |      |      |
   | **Nit**        | Polish; can be deferred             |      |      |

4. Fix all **Blocker** findings. Confirm with the user before starting.

5. Re-run checks. Commit when clean:
   ```
   git add -A
   git commit -m "fix: align existing code with guardrails (Layer 6)"
   ```

> Use `/review` for the same severity-grouped analysis on individual changesets.

---

## Layer 7 — Governance activation

Human steps — confirm these are done before declaring the upgrade complete:

- [ ] Branch protection is enabled on `main` (Settings → Branches → ruleset with three required checks)
- [ ] The next change to this project will go via a feature branch + PR, not a direct push to `main`
- [ ] Open Dependabot PRs have been reviewed individually; any grouped PR that fails CI has been closed
- [ ] `gh` CLI is installed (optional but enables `/pr`): `winget install --id GitHub.cli` or see [cli.github.com](https://cli.github.com)
- [ ] `gitleaks` is installed locally for pre-commit parity with CI (optional; CI enforces it regardless)

---

## Record upgrade version

After completing all approved layers, write the applied template version to this project.
Read the current template version from `TEMPLATE_PATH/.cursor/guardrail-version` (also mirrored in
`TEMPLATE_PATH/guardrail-layers.json` → `guardrailVersion`) — do not hardcode a version number, it will
always go stale. Write that exact value into this project's `.cursor/guardrail-version`:

```
cat TEMPLATE_PATH/.cursor/guardrail-version > .cursor/guardrail-version
```

Add `.cursor/guardrail-version` to this project's git tracking if it is not already tracked:

```
git add .cursor/guardrail-version
git commit -m "chore: record guardrail template version"
```

On future runs, `/guardrail-upgrade` compares this file against `TEMPLATE_PATH/.cursor/guardrail-version` to identify drift.

---

## Hard rules (never break these)

- Treat `TEMPLATE_PATH` as read-only — never create, edit, or delete files inside the reference clone itself. This keeps `git pull --ff-only` always able to fast-forward cleanly on the next run.
- Treat `guardrail-prescription.json` (if present) as read-only too — never create, edit, or delete it. It is an input from Throughline or another governance tool, not an output of this command.
- **Never copy `templateMeta` files** into the target project. Read `TEMPLATE_PATH/guardrail-layers.json` → `templateMeta.files` (hub-only: playbook, Throughline docs, scheduled AI-review workflows, Cloudflare playbook hosting, starter-sync scripts, etc.). Those paths must not appear in any layer copy step. If the target still has any of them from an old fat “Use this template” generation, list them once and offer to strip per `TEMPLATE_PATH/docs/post-generate-cleanup.md` — do not re-add them.
- Only copy files listed under `adoptionLayers` Layers 1–5 (plus writing `.cursor/guardrail-version`). That is the entire consumer surface — same set synced to `cursor-guardrails-starter`.
- Never copy `src/`, `index.html`, `vite.config.ts`, or any application code into a project that already has its own.
- Never overwrite a `.env` file or create one with real values.
- Never remove lines from an existing `.gitignore` — only add.
- Never replace a `tsconfig.json` wholesale — always merge strict settings in.
- Never disable a linter or type rule to silence an error; fix the cause.
- If anything is ambiguous (e.g. the project has a conflicting ESLint setup), stop and ask rather than guessing.
- Do not declare the upgrade complete if any Blocker findings from Layer 6 remain unresolved.
